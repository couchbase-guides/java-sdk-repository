This guide walks you through the process of using the Couchbase SDK repository abstraction to store a Customer document in http://developer.couchbase.com/[Couchbase].

== What you'll build

You will store a `Customer` link:/understanding/POJO[POJOs] in a Couchbase database using the http://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/current/sdks/java-2.2/java-intro.html[Couchbase SDK]'s repository abstraction.


== What you'll need

* 15-30 minutes
* A Java code editor with java 1.8+
* Maven
* link:http://www.couchbase.com/nosql-databases/downloads[Couchbase Server 4.5+] (follow the instructions to install Couchbase and create a bucket - this guide assumes you will have it running locally)

== Setup

=== Install and launch Couchbase
With your project set up, you can install and launch Couchbase.
    
For whatever operating system you are using, instructions and downloads can be found at  http://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/current/install/install-intro.html[http://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/current/install/install-intro.html].

After you install Couchbase, launch it. You should see a webpage opening in your default browser allowing you to setup Couchbase


=== Dependencies

The following code will rely on the Couchbase Java SDK so make sure you add the correct dependency:

        <dependencies>
            <dependency>
                <groupId>com.couchbase.client</groupId>
                <artifactId>java-client</artifactId>
                <version>2.2.5</version>
            </dependency>
        </dependencies>
    
== Code

=== Define a simple entity
In this example, you store `Customer` objects.

`src/main/java/hello/Customer.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/Customer.java[]
----

Here you have a `Customer` class with three attributes, `username`, `firstName`, and `lastName`. You also have a single constructor to populate the entities when creating a new instance.

NOTE: In this guide, the typical getters and setters have been left out for brevity.

`username` bears the `@Id` annotation. The field annotated with `@Id` will be used as Key of your document. 

The other two properties, `firstName` and `lastName`, are left unannotated. It is assumed that they'll be mapped to fields that share the same name as the properties themselves.

The convenient `toString()` method will print out the details about a customer.


=== Create an Application class
Here you create an Application class with all the components.

`src/main/java/hello/Application.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/Application.java[]
----

The `main()` method starts by intializing a connection to the cluster by calling `CouchbaseCluster.create()`. By default this method will attempt a connection to a cluster on the same machine, which is to say with 127.0.0.1 as IP.

Then use the `openBucket` method. By default it opens the bucket named default. A bucket is where you store k/v pairs in Couchbase.

Since the goal of this project is to store a Customer entity, you need to use a repository. A Repository can be opened easily by calling the `bucket.repostory()` method. Then you can create the Customer entity to be stored.

This entity must be wrapped in an `EntityDocument<Customer>` class using `EntityDocument.create(content)`. The next step is to insert the document using the repository with `repository.upsert(document)`.

== Run

To test this worked, fetch the document again using `repository.get("asmith")` and print the result. Once you run the application you should see something like this:
....
Jun 01, 2016 11:23:37 AM com.couchbase.client.core.CouchbaseCore <init>
INFO: CouchbaseEnvironment: {sslEnabled=false, sslKeystoreFile='null', sslKeystorePassword='null', queryEnabled=false, queryPort=8093, bootstrapHttpEnabled=true, bootstrapCarrierEnabled=true, bootstrapHttpDirectPort=8091, bootstrapHttpSslPort=18091, bootstrapCarrierDirectPort=11210, bootstrapCarrierSslPort=11207, ioPoolSize=8, computationPoolSize=8, responseBufferSize=16384, requestBufferSize=16384, kvServiceEndpoints=1, viewServiceEndpoints=1, queryServiceEndpoints=1, searchServiceEndpoints=1, ioPool=NioEventLoopGroup, coreScheduler=CoreScheduler, eventBus=DefaultEventBus, packageNameAndVersion=couchbase-jvm-core/1.2.5 (git: 1.2.5), dcpEnabled=false, retryStrategy=BestEffort, maxRequestLifetime=75000, retryDelay=ExponentialDelay{growBy 1.0 MICROSECONDS, powers of 2; lower=100, upper=100000}, reconnectDelay=ExponentialDelay{growBy 1.0 MILLISECONDS, powers of 2; lower=32, upper=4096}, observeIntervalDelay=ExponentialDelay{growBy 1.0 MICROSECONDS, powers of 2; lower=10, upper=100000}, keepAliveInterval=30000, autoreleaseAfter=2000, bufferPoolingEnabled=true, tcpNodelayEnabled=true, mutationTokensEnabled=false, socketConnectTimeout=1000, dcpConnectionBufferSize=20971520, dcpConnectionBufferAckThreshold=0.2, queryTimeout=75000, viewTimeout=75000, kvTimeout=2500, connectTimeout=5000, disconnectTimeout=25000, dnsSrvEnabled=false}

....

The most important line is the last one showing the Customer entity has been stored successfuly. The previous line are logs showing the Couchbase SDK connection to the cluster.

== Summary
Congratulations! You set up a Couchbase server and wrote a simple application that uses a repository to save objects to and fetch them from a database -- all without writing a concrete repository implementation.
